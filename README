DLobotomize - Fix D-Link exploits with extreme prejudice

dlobotomize is a tool which uses exploits in the httpd in D-Link's
network device firmware to stop httpd and stunnel, closing all listening
ports and thus closing the hole.  This does make it somewhat impossible
to configure the device, so you should only use it after you have things
configured, and any reconfiguration will require rebooting the device.

To query whether your device is exploitable:

$ dlobotomize --host 192.168.1.1 --query

And to effect the fix:

$ dlobotomize --host 192.168.1.1 --lockdown

You can also run any arbitrary command like so:

$ dlobotomize --host 192.168.1.1 telnetd

But be aware that blocking commands like telnetd will cause dlobotomize
to wait on the HTTP response that will never come.

You can read more about the exploit here:

It works on my DAP-1650, and apparently also on the DIR-890L, and
probably many other D-Link devices.
